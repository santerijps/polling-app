# PollingAPP
This application can be used for creating public polls and answering to them.

The behaviour is very similar to that of [Strawpoll's](http://strawpoll.me), but is a lot prettier and cleaner.

This application was built using the MEAN-stack as a project for the Web Frameworks college module.

A live demo can be found on [Heroku](http://sjps.herokuapp.com).
